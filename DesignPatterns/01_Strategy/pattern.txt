Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Design principles used:
	* Favor composition over inheritance.
	* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
	* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
